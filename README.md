## Overview
Heineken's desire to evaluate the quality of a large and small event, as well as the brand's appearance density in diverse environments from  pubs, shops, bars. Currently there are many techniques such as RAG, LLM but have not solved Heineken's problem. Therefore we decided to choose YOLO-V5 as a simple but effective model. We choose Data Central solution instead of new but not effective methods to solve this problem like Multi-Language model.
